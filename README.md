I'm trying to use the fantastic Trumbowyg editor not as an editor for WEB pages, but as an editor for contracts and public documents, 
with numbered header / footer and A4 page formatting with justified text and images, 
I'm looking for a freelancer to help us with implementation of these functions or some plugin that helps us reach the goal
